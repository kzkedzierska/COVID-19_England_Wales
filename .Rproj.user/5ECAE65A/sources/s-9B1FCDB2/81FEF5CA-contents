## Motivation

As probably many of the data scientist I wanted to ease my anxiety caused by the COVID-19, and  for some reason analysing COVID-19 data is doing that job. I am a **computational biologists** and all the plots I am making here are just *observations*. I am not claiming any conclusions, nor do I do any predictions. All the code is open source, and free for anyone to use, available on [github]()

## Setup 

Loading up the necessary packages (installing them if they are missing). Setting up defaults and tweaking the plotting defaults.
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
cran_pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "ggsci", "patchwork", "readxl")
source("./scripts/load_pkgs.R")
load_packages(cran_pkgs = cran_pkgs)

# Set defaults for plotting
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Data 

Data is coming from [Office for National Statistics, *Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional* dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales). For now I am downloading the data manually into the `data` directory. It would be great to download it directly.

### Weekly figures 

Both 2020 and 2019 figures for comparison of the trend. The 2020 will be changed each week, while 2019 remains stable. 

*Note:* Unfortunately due to formatting of the data the following code is not entirely reproducible as there are parts of it that would have to be adjusted with each newiteration of the spreadsheet. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df_2019 <- 
  read_xls("./data/publishedweek522019.xls", 
           sheet = "Weekly figures 2019", skip = 3)[c(4,5,9),-c(1,2)] %>%
  mutate(value = c("total_deaths", "total_deaths_ave5", "respiratory_deaths")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-value), as.numeric) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "week", 
               values_to = "number_of_deaths", -value) %>%
  mutate(year = "2019")

current_2020_spreadsheet <- "./data/publishedweek1320201.xlsx"
sheets_2020 <- readxl::excel_sheets(current_2020_spreadsheet)
df_2020_ <- 
  read_xlsx(current_2020_spreadsheet, 
            sheet = sheets_2020[5], skip = 4)[c(4,6,9, 10),-c(1,2)] %>%
  mutate(value2 = c("total_deaths", "total_deaths_ave5",
                   "respiratory_deaths", "covid_deaths"),
         value = c("total_deaths", "total_deaths_ave5",
                   "respiratory_deaths", "respiratory_deaths")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-value, -value2), as.numeric) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "week", 
               values_to = "number_of_deaths", 
               -c(value, value2))
df_2020 <- 
  df_2020_ %>% 
  select(-value2) %>%
  mutate(year = "2020") %>%
  filter(!is.na(number_of_deaths))

df_all <- bind_rows(list(df_2019, df_2020)) %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week), 
         week_ = lubridate::ymd("2020-01-03") + 7 * (week-1)) %>%
  group_by(value, week, week_, year) %>%
  summarise(number_of_deaths = sum(number_of_deaths)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

### COVID-19 specific datasets

*Note:* Total number of deaths in `Covid-19 - Place of occurence` sheet is off by a factor of 10.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
place_of_death <- 
  read_xlsx(current_2020_spreadsheet, 
            sheet = sheets_2020[9], skip = 4)[1:7,1:3] %>%
  rename(place = `...1`, 
         `All` = `Number of deaths`, 
         `COVID-19` = `Number of COVID-19 deaths`) %>%
  filter(place != "Total") %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "cause", 
               values_to = "number_of_deaths",
               -place)

actual_vs_reported <-
  read_xlsx(current_2020_spreadsheet, sheet = sheets_2020[7], skip = 4, 
            col_types = c("date", "numeric", 
                          "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))[1:23, 1:5] %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "source",
               values_to = "number_of_deaths",
               -Date)
```

## Mortality in the context of past years

### Tota

Still very early, but looks like the overall weekly numbers are higher than last year, and the past 5 years.

```{r}
total <- 
  df_all %>%
  filter(value == "total_deaths") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week_, y = number_of_deaths, fill = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(df_all, value == "total_deaths_ave5" & year == "2019"),
              color = "grey60") +
  labs(y = "Number of deaths", 
       title = "Weekly total deaths [grey = 5 year average]") + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_aaas()
total
```

### Respiratory deaths

COVID-19 deaths are increasing the number of repiratory deaths. 

```{r}
respiratory <-
  df_all %>%
  filter(value == "respiratory_deaths") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week_, y = number_of_deaths, 
             group = year, color = year, shape = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_aaas() +
  labs(y = "Number of deaths", title = "Weekly respiratory deaths") + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
respiratory
```

However, the difference is not yet visible on the cummulative scale. 

```{r}
cummulative_respiratory <- 
  df_all %>%
  arrange(week) %>%
  group_by(value, year) %>%
  mutate(cum = cumsum(number_of_deaths)) %>%
  filter(value == "respiratory_deaths") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week_, y = cum, color = year, shape = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_aaas() +
  labs(y = "Number of deaths", title = "Cummulative respiratory deaths") + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
cummulative_respiratory
```

COVID-19 deaths increase exponentailly, while the other respiratory deths seem to be stable.

```{r}
df_2020_ %>%
  filter(value == "respiratory_deaths") %>%
  mutate(value2 = gsub("respiratory_deaths", "other_respiratory_deaths", value2),
         week = as.numeric(week), 
         week_ = lubridate::ymd("2020-01-03") + 7 * (week-1)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(number_of_deaths)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week_, y = number_of_deaths, color = value2, shape = value2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_uchicago() +
  labs(y = "Number of deaths", title = "Weekly respiratory deaths",
       color = "Cause of death", shape = "Cause of death") + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=12, echo=FALSE}
total / respiratory / cummulative_respiratory + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
ggsave("./plots/up_to200327.png")
```

## COVID-19 specific stats

### Place of deaths

As of 27 of March, there is not a lot of deaths reported outside of the hospitals. This however can change, as we get more data. 

```{r}
place_of_death %>% 
  mutate(place = gsub("Hospitals \\(acute or community not psychiatric\\)", 
                      "Hospitals", place),
         place = gsub("Other communal establishments", 
                      "Other communal\nestablishments", place)) %>%
  group_by(cause) %>%
  mutate(fract = round(number_of_deaths / sum(number_of_deaths) * 100, 2)) %>%
  group_by(place) %>%
  filter(max(fract) > 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(place, fract, fill = cause)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_nejm() +
  labs(title = "Place of death",
       y = "Fraction ofreported deaths",
       fill = "Cause of death:") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 16))
```

### Discrepancies between  reported numbers

The numbers reported by the government are lower than the actual number of deaths each day. Some of that comes from the delay in confirming the cause of death.  

```{r, fig.width=13}
col_scheme <- c("#E18727", "#20854E", "#008B6C", "#009093")
names(col_scheme) <- unique(actual_vs_reported$source)
discrepancies <-
  actual_vs_reported %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = number_of_deaths, color = source, shape = source)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))+
  labs(color = "Source", shape = "Source", 
       y = "Cummulative number of deaths") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 16)) 

discrepancies + 
  labs(title = "Discrepancies between the reported numbers of COVID-19 deaths in England and Wales")

# (discrepancies + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs(title = "[linear scale]")) / 
#   (discrepancies + scale_y_log10() + labs(title = "[log scale]")) + 
#   plot_annotation(title =  "Discrepancies between the reported numbers")
```

Looking at the daily death rates it becomes clear that there is a significant lag in the data.

```{r, fig.width=13}
actual_vs_reported %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate(deaths_on_that_day = number_of_deaths - lag(number_of_deaths)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = deaths_on_that_day, color = source, shape = source)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))+
  labs(color = "Source", shape = "Source", 
       y = "Number of deaths on the day") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 16)) 
  
```
